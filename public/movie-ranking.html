<h2>The Five Best Movies of All Time (according to me)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>East of Eden</h3>
<p>James Dean's absolute best. Monterey, California shines as the backdrop for this gorgeous movie about a father and son.</p>
<h3>Dumb and Dumber</h3>
<p>Possibly the movie I most quote. It's an instant pick me up when I am having a bad day.</p>
<h3>Kingdom of Heaven</h3>
<p>My favorite Christopher Nolan movie. Aesthetically it is stunning. The history, the story telling, *chef's kiss*.</p>
<h3>Bull Durham</h3>
<p>Another one I quote entirely too much. One of those, "if it's on, I am watching" movies.</p>
<h3>Dead Poet's Society</h3>
"Language was invented for one reason - to woo women." Do I need another reason to love this movie?
